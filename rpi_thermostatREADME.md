This is a simple thermostat program, using a ds18x20 temperature sensor on the 
Raspberry Pi. See Thermostat.png for circuit diagram.

Remember to enable 1-wire in sudo raspi-config etc.
See https://randomnerdtutorials.com/raspberry-pi-ds18b20-python
for setup.

Use: python3 rpi_thermostat.py <setpoint temp>

Enjoy!
